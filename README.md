`example-config.js12` is a JSON-based config file.
Try to open it and change field types, both VSC and WebStorm will give you a suggestion on type errors and editing `field3` will give you a
nice suggestion of possible options (since schema for configuration file has an `enum` for that field).

`.js12` extension was chosed arbitrarily to show that files can have
arbitrary extensions and both VSC and WebStorm support mapping JSON schemas to them.
